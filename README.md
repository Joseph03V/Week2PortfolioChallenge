# My WebDev Portfolio

## Functionality
This program is for personal use. It shows employers my skill, as 
well as provides them with additional projects I have worked on.
As of right now, I only have one project that I personally created
so it is linked in the first link. The other links dont have any
projects

## Improvements
I plan to add projects to the links as time goes on and I continue
to develop projects, and build my portfolio. It could actually serve as
something I show to employers. I also plan to clean up the code as this
was a timed project. So the orginization isn't all there. 

## Challenges I Faced
I struggled immensly with css grid and flexboxes. Figuring this out was
hard and I think I still did it wrong. But it came out how it was supposed to look so. I also struggled with positioning randome elements such as headers.

## What did I learn
I learned how to use CSS grid to an extent. I also learned how to turn images into links and add styling to them.
