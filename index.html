        <section class="About-Me-P"> 
            <P>This is a paragraph about my work. I have done alot of work. Work is fun.
                I am a mad scientist. I invented alot of stuff including this website. CSS is 
                really a battle when it comes to grids and flexes. But good thing i'm a genius. 
                More information about my work. More information. Blah blah blah? More information
                more words. PLEASE HIRE ME. PLEASE HIRE ME. PLEASE HIRE ME. Thank you for coming to 
                my TedTalk. Nevermind I want to make this paragraph bigger. Words words stuff 
                very interesting stuff. Im adding words about my projects. Persuading you to 
                hire me. Please hire me. Words. Im adding words. This is a very long paragraph. 
                More paragraph. Adding even more paragraph. I wonder if the graders actually read 
                this. That would be kind of funny. More paragraph. Longer paragraph. 
            </P>
            <p>I thought that was enough words but I realized the mock up has two paragraphs lol.
                so here's s'mor words for ya. words words. words. I truly just don't know what else 
                to say. I'm at Mcdonalds right now doing this project and this coffee was delicious.
                One more scentence. Technically three. Should we go for four? Ok this is enough paragraph.
                Nevermind it wasn't enough I need to add more, CSS IS SO HARD. Hour 3 of this project 
                I think i'm about 60 percent done. Words words words. More paragraph nonsense. 
                Making this longer because I want it to be. Words. Blah blah blah. Ok i think this is enough.
                Adding more here, words words, words. Hire me. Words, Look at my cool projects!
                Words. Heyyy look at this. Look at my projects. Hire me. Words words words. 
                Ok this is the last line of words. Words words words words. Pls give me good grade.
